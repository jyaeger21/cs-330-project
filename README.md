# cs-330-project

How do I approach designing software? I start by thinking about the needs of the project, and what the goals are.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? I have a much greater understanding of coding front end, APIs, OPENGL, and creating 3D scenes.
What design process did you follow for your project work? I used an iterative process, constantly refining the project and improving it while listening to feedback.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? These tactics are great when listening to users and changing the product accordingly.
How do I approach developing programs? Taking it piece by piece, coding chunks and testing functionality.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? The importance of collaboration and getting help when needed.
How did iteration factor into your development? It was a major part.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? Adding new functionality to improve the experience of the project as the project became more stable and reached the requirements.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? It provides great problem solving and strong foundation for many career paths.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? Many courses I can use the knowledge gained and build upon it.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? I am interested in UI/UX design and now have a much greater understanding of computational graphics and visualitzation which can be used to crete UI/UX.
